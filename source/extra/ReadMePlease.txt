Gabe-

SOOOOO like this mod started way back of Jan, 2021 (or at least thats when it got featured!) 
From my part of the story, I had found the reskin mod way back and it had night-of-nigts kinda like...
combined with the song Milf. I thought it sounded kinda off in my opinion, so I grabbed the actual
night of nights, and charted that! Needless to say it wasn't the best, but it was my first ever
4k rhythm game chart! Eventually though, it got popular somehow! Funky Friday put it in (before recharting it way later)
and I found BlackTiger's discord. I messaged him, and after some talking and stuff, we started working on more.
Week 5 was the next one to be made. It was at that time i got the trial of FL studio. So i tried to
make voices for the songs. Yet again, not the best ive done. But it was what we used. Week 3 presented problems
with spriteseets. The mod had just been using base game or kade around that time, and well...

I cant code. I still cant code very well. Ima be honest some of the coding i asked help for XD

But, somehow it bareley worked and was kinda funtional. Still no voices but yea! Some other people
in a friend server were also playtesting. People like Jxed and others were really cool. I dont really remember much 
from around this point. I just know that Mellowdy became another really cool team member we met, and that week 4
broke completly. Kade engine failled to work, Andromeda too. Then, some time later a discord server was made as we were near
all weeks being done. Only like week 2 and 6 were missing and more people were probably gonna be needed than just me and BlackTiger.
We made the server and... WHoops BlackTigers PC completly dieded. for an entire summer basically nothing happened. But somehow way later,\
he started working on it again. (i kinda forgot what happened to fix the problem) Week 6 in development kinda, and ごま (or Goma) Shows up with
the idea of giving the characters voices with UTAU. I loved the idea and im pretty shure alot of others did too.
They were added on the team and songs started to have voices to go with the songs. Now i kinda skipped on this, but Phych Engine was becoming relevant
somewhere inbetween this (i forgot kinda when) but we started using that. Thankfully Shadowmario can code.
Stuff was working and everything was going well! Week 6 was being made and was eventually finished. I got to do the voices
for week 6 (gameplay wise) and week 2 was all thats left.

Enter Joker. He did the epic remixes for week 2. Man volunteered to help us out! The three songs were done quickly as well, and i did the 
first song's voices.

And now we are here one year from the start. I like FNF. Fun game and the people ive met are all really nice.
I know not everyones the best, but i feel like as long as you just enjoy what you do, and just go your own way,
its not such a bad community either. Alflac and Volume are some cool friends too ive made that way.

Anyways now that you have the history on this mod, go down and play it! And enjoy!

Well, what can I say... This has been a wild ride! Even with all the problems we faced I still think this is the most fun I've ever had on a project
and I can't thank everyone enough for their commitment, both the people that helped me and Gabe develop it, Gabe himself, and YOU, the player.
I really hope you enjoy this mod, it had a lot of work put into it! And stay tuned for Update#2! We'll try our best to overcome whatever this mod brought!
:)

I honestly have no idea what to say... But it has been pretty fun working on this mod!
Before becoming a team member, I used to play this mod a lot and it got me into touhou, which I'm pretty grateful about.
Thank you everyone in the team, and thank you for playing!
See you in update #2
